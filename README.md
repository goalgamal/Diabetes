Overview
The Diabetes Prediction Project aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diabetes early by leveraging machine learning. The tool takes various health parameters as input and outputs the probability of diabetes in a given individual.

Key objectives:

Improve early detection of diabetes.
Provide an educational resource for machine learning enthusiasts.
Features
Training and Testing: Trained on a high-quality diabetes dataset to ensure accurate predictions.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly app for inputting patient data and viewing predictions.
Reproducibility: Includes code for training, testing, and deployment.
Customizability: Easily adapt the code to use different datasets or features.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Flask or Streamlit (for deployment)
Version Control: Git and GitHub
